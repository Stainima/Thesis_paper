\chapter{CONCLUSION}

This paper presents a re-implementation of a state-of-the-art algorithm in a clean-room environment using the C programming language. Although a complete re-implementation was not achieved, this paper provides a detailed account of all the steps undertaken, with appropriate references to the corresponding code. This partial re-implementation providing a starting point for future research and development related to ARVADA.

Alongside the re-implementation, this paper highlights the challenges encountered and identifies areas in the original work where explanations were insufficient or ambiguous. All source code references have been documented, and the codebase has been made openly available for review and further improvement.
